# What X-Days of Javalin is 
Welcome to X-Days of Javalin! This is a self-study code challenge/camp that aims to get you up and running in developing fullstack 
web-applications in javalin. The stack chosen here is to add a tool to *your* toolbox for quick prototyping and development of web applications. At the end of this course, you should be able to 

1. Write Rest APIs using Javalin
2. Manage your Data in SQL
4. Version and Manage a Schema using Code
3. Create and Integrate a Frontend
5. Deploy your web application on a public cloud

Along the way, you will be exposed to various technologies and terminologies. Where appropriate, you will be provided with outlinks if
you want to dive deeper into an aspect, or general knowledge.

This course is highly opinionated - this might not be the optimal flow for *your* case or organization, so please note that the implementation 
here can be done in a different way, and this course is by no means the authority for developing fullstack applications using javalin, and the 
design and architecture patterns used here are by no means the only viable or even best ones.

# What X-Days of Javalin is not
X-Days of Javalin is *not* a full code camp that will take you from zero to hero in development, and you should not treat it as such.

# Pre-Requisites
To get the best out of this course, you should at least

1. Have a good grasp of Java syntax and Object-Oriented programming
2. Have a beginner understanding of JavaScript syntax
3. Have a good understanding of HTML5 and CSS
4. Have a begginer understanding of SQL - preferrably MySQL syntax

I encourage you to revise these concepts before you dive in. It would also be nice to have a general awareness of

1. Design Patterns
2. S.O.L.I.D Principles

# Structure & Plan
For this course, we will be building a (simplified) clone of [Medium](https://medium.com). This will be done across 6 modules, with 
each module being composed of multiple days of learning - but may take you longer or less time  to complete - this course is completely self-paced. The 6 modules are

1. Introduction
2. Javalin Concepts
3. SQL and JDBI
4. SQL and Flyway 
5. Frontend with JavalinVue
6. Containerization and Deployment

The application code will progressively be enhanced day by day, so you can follow through the changes as they happen. Each day will have its
own page, with the rationale behind the change and resources to better understand the underlying concept. It is highly encouraged to follow 
along locally and experiment.

# Ackgnowledgements 
Special thanks to [David Ã…se](https://github.com/tipsy) for creating and maintaining javalin, and to the flyway, javalin, vue, docker, and 
JDBI maintainers and contributor community for their hard work that gave us the tech on which we can build our ideas. Additionally thanks go to [Thinkster](https://thinkster.io) for their [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) demo app idea, which heavily enspired the project this course uses as an example. Lastly, I'd like to thank the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) communities, without whom this website wouldnt even exist.
